          <h3>Our Approach</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
          To tackle these we have come up with clear notions and solutions.Â  Finances in this contemporary world are the major source to generate development and to transform the Vision into sustainable Objectives and finally to reality.
          This earnestly calls for monetary sacrifices in contributing continuously over a defined period to attain Capital Muscle.
          We have resolved to contribute:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Admission Fees of Ksh 500 per Member (non refundable),</li>
            <li>Monthly Subscription Fees of Ksh 1,000 per month, before the 10th of every calendar month.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          These payments to ensure Accountability and Transparency shall be deposited to <b>KH-SHG Ksh Gulf African Bank Account: 0800070601 via Mpesa Paybill 985050</b> and for <b>Donations to the Ksh Account: (0800070602 to be opened soon) for Diaspora send directly to GAB: Swift Code: GAFRKEN</b>
          </p>
          <p>
          The Banks issues a Monthly Statement to the group and the Statement will be shared in our Telegram platform for all to be able to trace their payments and to relate with those of fellow KH-SHG Members and to have an overview of the progress into the contributions.
          </p>

        <div className='col-md-6 col-sm-12'></div>
      </div>

      <div className='row'>
        <div className="col-md-6 col-sm-12 pt-5">
          <img src={happyPerson1} alt="Kenyan Hadharim" className='img-fluid' style={{ borderRadius:"10px" }} />
        </div>

        <div className='col-md-6 col-sm-12 pt-5'>
          <div class="card mb-3">
            <div className='card-header'>
              <h3 class="card-title">Our Target</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p>
              We reiterate for all to be achieved that all payments should be directed into the above-mentioned GAB Ksh Account. <b>Our target is to reach 1,000 or more Members in less than two (2) years.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
              The main objective is the economic empowerment of our <b>KH-SHG Members</b>. This is a global trend nowadays characterised by stiffer economic challenges in this world with many flocks not able to achieve the more elusive power due to the rising costs, UNLESS they unite.
              </p>
              <p>
              Out of this zeal came our noble vision for the future and the coming generations of our KH-SHG Members. As vision dictates it is an undertaking stretching over 5 (five) or fewer years depending upon our numbers and contributions.
